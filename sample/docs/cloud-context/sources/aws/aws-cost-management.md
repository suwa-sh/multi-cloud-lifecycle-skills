invoices, and analyze, organize, plan, and optimize your costs.

To get started, set up your billing to match your requirements. For individuals or small organizations, AWS will automatically charge the credit card provided.

For larger organizations, you can use AWS Organizations to consolidate your charges across multiple AWS accounts. You can then configure invoicing, tax, purchase order, and payment methods to match your organization's procurement processes.

If you have multiple AWS Organizations, use billing transfer to centrally manage and pay for all your organizations from a single account.

You can allocate your costs to teams, applications, or environments by using cost categories or cost allocation tags, or using AWS Cost Explorer. You can also export data to your preferred data warehouse or business intelligence tool.

See the following overview of features to help you manage your cloud finances.

### AWS Billing Conductor {#billing-conductor-service}

Billing Conductor is a custom billing service that supports the showback and chargeback workflows of AWS Partners reselling AWS services, solutions, and AWS customers purchasing cloud services directly through AWS. You can customize a second, alternative version of your monthly billing data. The service models the billing relationship between you and your customers or business units.

Billing Conductor doesn\'t change the way that you\'re billed by AWS each month. Instead, you can use the service to configure, generate, and display rates to specific customers over a given billing period. You can also use it to analyze the difference between the rates that you apply to your groupings relative to the actual rates for those same accounts from AWS.

As a result of your Billing Conductor configuration, the management account can also see the custom rate that\'s applied on the billing details page of the [AWS Billing and Cost Management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/bills){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}. The management account can also configure AWS Cost and Usage Reports per billing group.

When billing transfer users sign in to the bill transfer account, Billing Conductor enables the management account of the AWS organization that transfers their bills (bill source account) to view only their usage priced with the rates from the bill transfer account.

For more information about Billing Conductor, see the [AWS Billing Conductor User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/latest/userguide/what-is-billingconductor.html). For more information about billing transfer, see [Transfer billing management to external accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/orgs_transfer_billing.html).

### IAM {#IAM-service}

You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control who in your account or organization has access to specific pages on the Billing and Cost Management console. For example, you can control access to invoices and detailed information about charges and account activity, budgets, payment methods, and credits. IAM is a feature of your AWS account. You don\'t need to do anything else to sign up for IAM and there\'s no charge to use it.

When you create an account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you don\'t use the root user for your everyday tasks. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to perform the tasks that only the root user can perform.

For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see [Tasks that require root user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/root-user-tasks.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

By default, IAM users and roles in your account can\'t access the Billing and Cost Management console. To grant access, enable the **Activate IAM Access** setting. For more information, see [About IAM Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/control-access-billing.html#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate).

If you have multiple AWS accounts in your organization, you can manage linked account access to Cost Explorer data by using the **Cost Management preferences** page. For more information, see [Controlling access to Cost Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-access.html).

For more information about IAM, see the [IAM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/).

### AWS Organizations {#organizations-service}

You can use the consolidated billing feature in Organizations to consolidate billing and payment for multiple AWS accounts. Every organization has a *management account* that pays the charges of all the *member accounts*.

Consolidated billing has the following benefits:

::: itemizedlist
- **One bill** -- Get one bill for multiple accounts.

- **Easy tracking** -- Track charges across multiple accounts and download the combined cost and usage data.

- **Combined usage** -- Combine the usage across all accounts in the organization to share the volume pricing discounts, Reserved Instances discounts, and Savings Plans. This can result in a lower charge for your project, department, or company than with individual standalone accounts. For more information, see [Volume discounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/useconsolidatedbilling-effective.html#useconsolidatedbilling-discounts).

- **No extra fee** -- Consolidated billing is offered at no additional cost.
:::

For more information about Organizations, see the [AWS Organizations User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/).

### Billing transfer

You can use billing transfer to centrally manage and pay for multiple AWS Organizations from a single account.

Billing transfer allows a management account to designate an external management account to manage and pay for its consolidated bill. This centralizes billing while maintaining security management autonomy. To set up billing transfer, an external account (bill transfer account) sends a billing transfer invitation to a management account (bill source account). If the invitation is accepted, the external account becomes the bill transfer account. The bill transfer account then manages and pays for the bill source account\'s consolidated bill, starting on the date specified in the invitation.

For more information, see [Transfer billing management to external accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/orgs_transfer_billing.html).

### AWS Price List API {#pricelist-service}

AWS Price List API is a centralized catalog that you can programmatically query AWS for services, products, and pricing information. You can use the bulk API to retrieve up-to-date AWS service information in bulk, available in both JSON and CSV formats.

For more information, see [What is AWS Price List API?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/price-changes.html).
